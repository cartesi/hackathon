# Ideas to build on Cartesi Rollups

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Games - Autonomous Worlds
Want to do something different in blockchain gaming? Broaden the horizons of what we currently know? Check out the following for inspiration:
- Turn-Based games - Take a look at  [Ultrachess](https://github.com/Ultrachess/app)  or build something simple like Tic-Tac-Toe to get you started!
- Card games - Use cryptographic protocols and pre-existing libraries like [libTMCG](https://www.nongnu.org/libtmcg/) for secure and fair play online. Refer: [Poker](https://github.com/cartesi/poker) 
- Decentralized Sports Betting - See also: [Ballaum](https://github.com/tuler/ballaum) - FIFA Worldcup betting DApp
- AI v AI games - Have programmable scripts compete with each other. See also: [Screeps](https://screeps.com/)  
- Cellular automaton simulation with game logic - Think of Conway's Game of Life, Wireworld, Forest Fire, Langton‚Äôs Ant. Refer: [LIFE](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/life-81m99)
- Other interesting games for inspiration: [Core war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War): 2D CPU, MMO [Dwarf fortress](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/), [OPCraft](https://dev.optimism.io/opcraft-autonomous-world/)

## üë§ Social - Identity - Reputation system
Explore digital identities in the Web3 era and get inspired by: 
- Reputation layer - Build automated and user-defined reputation scores within an SQLite database. See also: [Attestation Station](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/attestation-station/#) (Optimism) 
- Decentralized [identicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) : Build unique profile pictures using the user's Ethereum address. See also: [Blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies) 
- Identity verification - Explore OpenCV applications in a decentralized manner. Refer: [Biometrics](https://github.com/souzavinny/rollups-examples/tree/dev/biometrics) on Cartesi Rollups 

## üåê Governance - DAOs
Use [SQLite](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/sqlite) and Cartesi Rollups [assets](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/erc20) template to build tools for DAOs. Complement the tools with other ideas discussed here.
- Decentralized Kickstarter - A tool to raise funding for community projects
- Decentralized Voting - A fully decentralized variant of [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) running on Cartesi Rollups. Refer: [Voting DApp](https://github.com/Sotatek-ManhNguyen3/cartesi_voting_system/tree/feature/profiles) on Cartesi Rollups
- Build a fully decentralized bounties and grants dashboard. See also: [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) 

## üñºÔ∏è Art - Dynamic NFTs
Looking to bring something new to the NFT space? Why not try:
- Generative art NFT minter - Check [Mandelbrot](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/frmandy-v1gr8) set for NFT designs See also: [AutoGlyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs) 
- Self-evolving [Soulbound NFTs](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) 
- AI Artist - Explore the possibilities of a decentralized text-to-image generator. See also: [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)

## ü§ñ AI/ML Algorithms
Looking to bring machine learning or AI applications to blockchain? Explore the possibilities with these ideas:
- Build an [m2cgen](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/m2cgen#changing-the-application) example with a new target dataset and algorithm. See also: [On-chain House price prediction](https://devfolio.co/projects/ghar-on-chain-a6ce)  
- k-Nearest Neighbour - build DApps using knn algorithm, think of image classification(Refer: [Iris Classifier](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/knn)), recommendation systems, signature recognition and more.
- Think of DeSci - Build a verifiable compute solution
- Voice-based account verification to prove identity on-chain.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Utility - Developer tools
Help strengthen tools for developers in the ecosystem by building things like:
- Alarm clock - Cron jobs to schedule tasks to run inside the Cartesi Machine
- IPFS data sharding framework
- Generic Marketplace framework (using SQLite)
- Build a template around decentralized oracle for real-world data (IoTEX or software-based solutions)

## üëÄ And more...  
- Build a learn-to-earn model for Cartesi Rollups - Make users complete certain tasks within a Rollups DApp and reward them in form of CTSI vouchers. 
- Think for DeFi tools that execute compute intensive tasks - An order book exchange, a sophisticated trading bot or think of insurance with IOT inputs.
